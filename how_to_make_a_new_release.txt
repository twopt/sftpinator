first time setup:
make a sftpinator directory
make sure your CVSROOT env var is set
cvs co sftpinator

this will make an sftpinator subdir with all the code, etc.

after the first time:
go to sftpinator
cvs up

every time:
go to where cnv is checked out (or check it)

copy x:\encryption\gpg_twopt\twopt_gpg_pubkey.txt
cvs ci twopt_gpg_pubkey.txt

this keeps the key in cnv up to date

go back to sftpinator

copy x:\encryption\gpg_twopt\twopt_gpg_pubkey.txt
cvs ci twopt_gpg_pubkey.txt
mk_sftpinator

now make the install package, in windows hit start
and then type iexpress.exe and run it

choose open existing self extraction directive file, and open sftpinator_install.sed
choose create package and hit next
on the page that says create package, hit next
it will now make the installer

eventually it will say "your package has been created". click finish.

you now have an updated sftpinator_install.exe in the sftpintor dir

with a browser, log into github, into the twopt org, and open the sftpinator repo

click the release button

on the release page, click "draft a new release"

for tag put the next number (i just bumped it from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1)

for title put "Sftpinator {tag}"
where tag is the tag you entered above

where it says describe this release, put the reason we're making a new release, whether
bug fix or whatever. i put "new gpg public key"

click where it says "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them." and select the sftpinator_install.exe you just made. it will then upload the new installer.

once it's done uploading, click "publish release".

you are now done.
